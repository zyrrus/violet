Here is a brief sample of the
language and its syntax
---

-- Import statements
import std.collections {
    Heap,
    HashMap,
}

-- Function declaration with types
fn fizz-buzz(i: Num): Str {
    --- This is technically a legal comment ---
    let fb = "";

    if i % 3 == 0 {
        fb = fb ++ "fizz";
    }

    if i % 5 == 0 {
        fb ++= "buzz";
    }

    return i if Str.is-empty(fb) else fb;
}

-- Function declaration without types
fn main() {
    const fb: Str = fizz-buzz();
    print(fb);
}
